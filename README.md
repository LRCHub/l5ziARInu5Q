[00:09.19] I'm very emotional, don't you know?
[00:12.28] I'm so fragile, but I'm full of integrity
[00:17.96] I'm very controlling, I need control
[00:21.07] I can let go, but I don't out of necessity
[00:26.76] I met you through a friend and you should know
[00:30.32] My intentions were good, but our chemistry was not that good
[00:35.91] We are very hypothetical people
[00:40.05] I think you catch my drift, but if not
[00:59.05] 
[00:43.04] Oh, Monica, I'm not the one for ya
[00:47.78] I'm not the one for ya, but I hope you find them soon
[00:51.85] Oh, Monica, I am not the one for ya (you)
[00:56.59] I'm not the one for ya, but I hope you find them soon
[01:23.09] 
[01:01.73] I-I-I will not lead you-u-u on, I
[01:06.39] I-I-I-I will not lead you on
[01:20.39] 
[01:10.83] I picked you up on a Friday night
[01:13.79] I was on time, as usual, I don't mess around
[01:19.65] I drove us up to the carnival, popcorn candy
[01:25.13] My favorite, would you like to dance with me?
[01:28.48] We had a lot of fun, but I know you're looking for someone
[01:33.47] That one, your one and only
[01:36.96] I will not let you down slowly
[01:40.77] I will not lead you on
[01:51.77] 
[01:44.77] Oh, Monica, I'm not the one for ya
[01:49.35] I'm not the one for ya, but I hope you find them soon
[01:53.57] Oh, Monica, I am not the one for ya (you)
[01:58.13] I'm not the one for ya, but I hope you find them soon
[02:24.63] 
[02:03.50] I-I-I will not lead you-u-u on, I
[02:08.04] I-I-I-I will not lead you on, on
[02:12.26] I-I-I will not lead you-u-u on, I
[02:16.75] I-I-I-I will not lead you on
[02:30.75] 
[02:20.99] Too many people wasting too much time
[02:25.34] Too many people keeping things inside their minds
[02:29.72] Too many people wasting too much time
[02:34.24] Too many people keeping things inside their minds
[02:58.74] 
[02:37.50] Oh, Monica (Monica), I'm not the one for ya
[02:42.19] I'm not the one for ya, but I hope you find them soon
[02:46.37] Oh, Monica, I am not the one for ya (you)
[02:50.93] I'm not the one for ya (Monica), but I hope you find them soon
[03:21.93] 
[02:56.23] I-I-I will not lead you-u-u on, I
[03:00.83] I-I-I-I will not lead you on, on
[03:04.91] I-I-I will not lead you-u-u on, I
[03:09.69] I-I-I-I will not lead you on
